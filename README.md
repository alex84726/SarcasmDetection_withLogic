# SarcasmDetection_withLogic
We use logic patterns discovered by linguists to do sarcasm detection with neural network

## Data
- Row data crawl from twiiter
- pre-trained word embedding
- pre-processed text (*.npy, *.pkl) and  related scripts
- discribe pre-process details in data/README.md

## Ruled_sarcasm_th

## Ruled_sarcasm_tf

## Other


============================
Todo List:
- check whether pre-trained embedding is right
- pre-process sentiment analysis(Stanford NLP), generate sentiment label
  Maybe modify Preprocess_files/logicnn_features.py

- feed sentiment label to "freed_dict" in train_logic.py
- check whether first-order-logic is right
